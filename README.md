# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Model-to-Predict-the-Placement-Status-of-Student

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Model to Predict the Placement Status of Student.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1 Start
2 Load and preprocess the dataset: drop irrelevant columns, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables using LabelEncoder.
3 Split the data into training and test sets using train_test_split.
4 Create and fit a logistic regression model to the training data.
5 Predict the target variable on the test set and evaluate performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
6 Display the confusion matrix using metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay and plot the results.
7 End
